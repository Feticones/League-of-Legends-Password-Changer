# League of Legends Password Changer
 This are openbullet 2 configs to bulk change password on Riot Accounts. I will upload more useful configs in the future!

## How to use

1. Import the config to OpenBullet 2
2. Import a Wordlist with the type: Credentials to OpenBullet 2 (Format must be Username:Password)
3. Go to "Jobs", then click on New and select Multi Run
4. Do your settings (import proxies, exporting to file system,...)
5. Create the Job and start the Bot, if you set everything correctly, the config will export the data with the format:
Username:Password | NewInfo = Username:NewPassword


## FAQ

### What proxy provider should I use?
You can use something like [intenseproxy.com ](https://intenseproxy.com/) or [packetstream.io ](https://packetstream.io/), because iproyal and some other providers  doesnt work.

### What is the difference between this two configs?
The config PwChangerOnePassword.opk changes the password from every Account to one password and the Config PwChangerRandomPassword.opk changes every password into a random one.
